URNG
====

Unpredictable Random Number Generator (URNG) - as close as you can get to a True RNG using software

This is an implementation of the URNG described in the scientific article by Suciu, Alin; Banescu, Sebastian and Marton, Kinga "Unpredictable Random Number Generator Based on Hardware Performance Counters", published on 24 Oct 2012, available at http://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-22410-2_10

The URNG may be used to generate number sequences with very high statistical quality. Information about how to install and run the URNG may be found in the user guide available at https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1U3R8RunEhedfJ3mobIXQRaW9v7QJxFNrMHcni9T4BI8
